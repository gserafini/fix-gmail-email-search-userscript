This is a Greasemonkey userscript to fix missing "Emails" search in Gmail.

**Version 1.5.0** - Now using pure vanilla JavaScript with no dependencies! No jQuery required, no TrustedTypes workarounds needed.

Please report any issues with the script here:

My plan is to keep this up to date as long as they're missing this key functionality.

This script delivers even better functionality than Gmail used to have.  In the past you would have to hover over a contact's name, wait for the pop-up to show, then click the "Emails" link to get a list of all the emails you had sent or received for that contact.

This plugin adds a search icon next to each contact's name.  Click the icon to do an instant search for all emails to or from that contact.  The script adds search icons next to all clickable email addresses, as well as in the hovercards that show up when you hover over a contact's name.

## What's New in v1.5.0

- Removed jQuery dependency - now pure vanilla JavaScript
- No longer requires separate TrustedHTML bypass script
- Uses native DOM methods for better compatibility
- Smaller file size and faster loading

Any bug-fixes or better ways to do this are welcome!
